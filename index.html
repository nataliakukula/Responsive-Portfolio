            <p><img id="portpic" src="assets/images/portfoliopic.jpg" alt="Natalia Kukula"> Natalia Kukula is a newbie web
                developer. She is aquainted with HTML and started crawling in CSS. Soon enough Java Script will be under
                her belt.
            </p>
            <p>
                Early on in life, Natalia Kukula got familiar with the vast customer service industry that led her to a career in hospitality.
                Therefore her soft skills are mastered to a "T". Now, she is on a new journey in the pursuit of technical
                abilities. She has an undergraduate degree in English and has had her share of experience with teaching (EFL
                and ESL). Her master's degree is in Journalism, and she majored in Media Marketing and Pulic Relations. Her
                first full time job was at a publishing company. As she likes to say, "She was making a little cash from
                people turning into ash" because she worked for the obituary department at the Chicago Tribune.
            </p>
            <p>
                Natalia is originally from Poland, where she lived most of her life. Her dad lives in Chicago and her mom in Warsaw. Another
                reason why she ended up working in hospitality is her passion for travel. As a student she would work in
                hostels, which would allow her to stay for free all around Europe. As a globetrotter, she says she is passionate
                about "pretty things" and people, therefore her ultimate goal is to mash her creative and entrepreneurial
                side with her love for human-centered design.
